# Computer Vision
Implementing basic algorithms, useful in image processing, from scratch

### Resources
The explanation for KNN algorithm is from this website: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/#h-what-is-knn-k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm

The KNN codes are from this repository: https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/Machine-Learning-From-Scratch/

The Kmean theory is adapted from a jupyter notebook provided in the _Data science: data acquisition and analysis_ class at the TU/e. And the plots and pictures for this part are taken from: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/08/introduction-image-segmentation-k-means-clustering.html
